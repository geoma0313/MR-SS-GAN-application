# MR-SS-GAN: Manifold-Regularized Semi-Supervised GAN
This repository implements MR-SS-GAN in the application of gas-bearing reservoir prediction.

The repository is mainly implemented based on PyTorch. 

The input file is *.npy, which is processed via Synchrosqueezing Transform. 

The network architecture implementation is mostly based on https://github.com/UCI-ML-course-team/GAN-manifold-regularization-PyTorch and https://github.com/bruno-31/GAN-manifold-regularization.
#  Requirements
The repo supports python 3.5 + pytorch

# Run the Code
python main.py
