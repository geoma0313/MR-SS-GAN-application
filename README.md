# MR-SS-GAN-application
This repository implements MR-SS-GAN in the application of gas-bearing reservoir prediction.
The repository is mainly implemented based on PyTorch. 
The *.npy file is the input, which is processed by synchronous squeeze transformation. 
The network architecture implementation mainly refers to https://github.com/UCI-ML-course-team/GAN-manifold-regularization-PyTorch and https://github.com/bruno-31/GAN-manifold-regularization.

Requirements
The repo supports python 3.5 + pytorch

Run the Code
python main.py
